# VerseOfTheDay

The Verse Of The Day (VOTD) application seeks to provide a method whereby bible verses based on certain themes can be sent to subscribers on a daily basis. The primary objective is to help subscribers keep their mind stayed on God through a consistent reminder of His word.

Administrators of the application will have the ability to create VOTD campaigns that select verses randomly from a curated pool, or to add context using themes that the verses represent.

Delivery methods will be open and initially support email with future plans to support SMS and other media.

The application will support multiple translations and versions of each verse stored.
